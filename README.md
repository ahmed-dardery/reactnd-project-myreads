# MyReads Project

This is my work on the MyReads Projet as a part of the Udacity React Nanodegree Course. It uses the starter template from [udacity](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).

## Development

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Deployment

The project is not yet ready for deployment.
